# TestDay
### A lightweight web app built to create and read customizable notecards

### This application is built using the Sinatra Framework, a relaxed rails-like solution.

## How to install

Fork and clone this repository. Then, run 

`bundle install`

to ensure all gems are installed. This application comes with the lightweight local server *Shotgun*, which can be executed by running 

`shotgun` 

The default port seems to be 9393, but can be adjusted with the -p flag, specifying an open (non-protected) port. For example:

`shotgun -p 8888`
